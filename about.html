        <p>Amsterdam is known as the Venice of the North, for having more than 100 kilometers of canals that formed 90 islands, connected by about 1,200 bridges. The city is located in the province of North Holland, in the west of the country. It comprises much of the northern part of Randstad, one of the largest urban agglomerations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million inhabitants. The city is also the cultural capital of the country. Among its famous residents are Anne Frank, artists Rembrandt and Vincent van Gogh, and philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Amsterdam is famous for the huge amount of bicycles and is the center of the world for them. Almost every main street has lanes for cyclists, and you can leave your bike anywhere.

            Schiphol Airport is about a 20-minute train ride from the center of Amsterdam. It is the largest airport in the Netherlands by number of passengers, the fifth in Europe (behind London Heathrow Airport, Frankfurt Airport, Charles de Gaulle in Paris and Barajas in Madrid) and the tenth in the world.
            
            Amsterdam has a temperate oceanic climate, with temperatures ranging from -7 °C in winter to 30 °C in summer, though rarely below -6 °C or above 27 °C.
